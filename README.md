# 1_recipes
In this project, I will create a simple HTML website. This will be a
simple recipe website with at least 3 webpages. HTML concepts/tags that 
I learned from previous Odin Project lessons

1) html boilerplate

2) anchor tags

3) ul, ol, li tags

4) strong, em tags

I added simple CSS styling after the end of CSS Foundations lesson.

Copied recipes from https://based.cooking/
