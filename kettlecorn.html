    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or oil of your choice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of popcorn kernels</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of sugar (brown sugar works too)</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil into your saucepan and 3 popcorn kernels</li>
        <li>Cover with lid and set stove to medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Once all 3 kernels pop, add in the rest of your kernels and shake to coat in oil. Pour sugar directly onto the kernels</li>
        <li>Shake the pot for 3 seconds, rest for 3 seconds, and repeat till the kernels start to pop steadily. Depending on your stove, you may need to lift the pot to shake.</li>
        <li><strong>Important</strong> Once you no longer hear pops for about 3 seconds, immediately transfer into a bowl to avoid burning.</li>
